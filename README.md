# tiademo

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

## Generate assets

- fluttergen -c pubspec.yaml

## Commit Convention

We follow a commit convention for better organization and clarity in version control. Each commit message should begin
with a type, followed by a colon and a space, then a concise description of the changes. Here are the types we use:

- `<type>: <description>`
- `feat`: for new features
- `chore`: for maintenance tasks or miscellaneous changes
- `refactor`: for code refactoring
- `fix`: for bug fixes
- `build`: for build-related changes
- `base`: for setting up base project or initial configurations
